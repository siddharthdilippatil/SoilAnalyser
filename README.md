# SoilAnalyser
Soil Analyser with AI-Based Crop and Fertiliser Recommendation System

ABSTRACT
By offering real-time soil data analysis and intelligent crop selection and fertilizer usage
suggestions, this research study introduces a novel AI-integrated soil analyser that aims to increase
agricultural output. To identify vital soil factors like nitrogen (N), phosphorous (P), potassium (K),
pH, moisture, and micronutrients, the suggested system makes use of a collection of Internet of Things
(IoT)-based sensors. A cloud-based artificial intelligence program processes sensor data and
produces customized recommendations based on both history and current data. To readily obtain this
vital information, farmers might use an intuitive smartphone application as the user interface. By
increasing yield results and optimizing fertilizer use, this approach seeks to advance sustainable
agriculture.
